Here's the code that I wrote for TwitterCLDR project during Google Summer of Code 2012:
  - src/ directory includes classes and modules for the features that I implemented from scratch
  - spec/ directory contains corresponding unit tests.

Besides implementing new features I made quite a lot of work on restructuring the project and refactoring existing code. You can find a much more detailed history of my work on GitHub â€“ https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-rb/commits/master?author=KL-7 .
